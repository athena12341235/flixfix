Our application provides personalized movie recommendations based on a userâ€™s movie preferences. This helps users discover movies that align with their tastes and preferences in a quick fashion, making their viewing experience more enjoyable. Once a user creates an account, they have the opportunity to 1) submit a movie review, 2) receive a movie recommendation, or 3) view a list of their movie review history. When a user chooses to receive a movie recommendation, they are asked to answer a set of 3 questions, which are used to gauge the user's current mood. The application will proceed to generate a list of 5 movie recommendations based on the user's answers, as well as their movie review history.
